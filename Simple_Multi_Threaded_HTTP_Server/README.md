Command to compile and run my code (to start server)- 
$ make all

-------------------------------------------------------------
## Description about my implementation - </br>

In my implementation - http server is created to handle GET request. On server side it checks for www folder. If folder is not found, server closes immediately.

http_server class has below functions - </br>

* # start_server() - </br> 
  This function - creates new socket for server , bind it with OS selected port number and listen client connection 
  then it call wait_for_client()
               
* # wait_for_client() - </br>
  This function - accepts client request and creates new thread and handover processing of client request to new thread by passing function process_request() and parameters in tuple form
                  
* # process_request() - </br>
  This function - process actual client request i.e. GET request and create response message using function create_header() and then call sends response to client and closes the client request. Once request is sent on server side it prints client information using function print_client_info()

* # create_header() - </br>
  This function takes 2 input - response_code and input_file_path </br>
  * response_code - 
    * 200 OK: Request succeeded and the information is returned in the response.
    * 404 Not Found: The requested document does not exist on this server.
		  
  * header includes below files - 
    * For 200 OK response
        * status line - includes status code (200/404) and associated phrase (OK/NOT FOUND)
        * 6 header lines - </br>
     Date - time and date when the HTTP response was created and sent by the server</br>
     Server - message was generated by which server</br>
     Last-Modified - time and date when the object was created or last modified</br>
     Accept-Ranges - unit that can be used by server to define range it support for request</br>
     Content-Length - number of bytes in the object being sent</br>
     Content-Type - The MIME type of this content sent</br>

    * For 404 NOT FOUND response
        * status line - includes status code (200/404) and associated phrase (OK/NOT FOUND)
		  
        * 2 header lines - </br>
     Date - time and date when the HTTP response was created and sent by the server</br>
     Server - message was generated by which server</br>

* # print_client_info() - 
  This function is called by multiple threads at a time - so it needs to be made thread safe before invoking. </br>
  This function prints details of client request in below format </br>
    * requested resource
    * client IP : client’s IP address in dotted decimal representation
    * client port : client’s port number
    * access times : the number of times this resource has been requested since the start of the HTTP server </br>

  dictionary - data structure needed to check number of times particular client request is processed

-------------------------------------------------------------

## Important python subroutines used - 

* # socket.socket - create socket - 
  @return - pointer to socket </br>
  @param - socket.AF_INET - communication domain in which the socket should be created (for IPV4) </br>
	       socket.SOCK_STREAM - type of service (for TCP connection) </br>
  s = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM) </br>

* # bind - bind socket to the port. An empty string this makes the server listen to requests coming from other computers on the network </br>
  @return - void </br>
  @param - tupe of - "" - this makes the server listen to requests coming from other computers on the network </br>
    0 -  this allows OS will choose any free port </br>
    s.bind(("", 0))  # bind takes one argument as tuple and binds port with ip </br>

* # listen - accept incoming connections
  @param - backlog connection - here 6 connections are kept waiting if the server is busy ..if a 7th socket trys to connect then the connection is refused. </br>
  s.listen(6) </br>

* # accept - accepts client request and creates new thread and handover processing of client request to new thread by passing function process_request() and parameters in tuple form
   @return - client information as tuple </br>
    - one newly created socket for every new client and </br>
    - second is address of client which include IP as well as port </br>
   client_new_socket, client_addr = self.s.accept()

* # close - closing the client socket / connection </br>
  client_new_socket.close() </br>
